### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    "Hello Christian!" This was a very new beginning for me. I have coded before going into 
college, but nothing has prepared me for C++ and I know it was going
to be a very troublesome task, but I know I could do it. 
I was able to write my first line of code and learn how make a repository.

* Lab 6 part 1

    Making a sandwich was a pretty easy task.
this was an introduction to validate arguments and I was able to make my dream sandwich.
The formating was quite the challenge but luckily me and my partner got through it.



* Lab 6 part 2

    Lab 6 part 2 was very fun to code, although it was troublesome, it was still fun to do.
I never knew I could be playing be playing blackjack with a computer but I did.
I learned how to validate arguments and the amount of arguments used.
